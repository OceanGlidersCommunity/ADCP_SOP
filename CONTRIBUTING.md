## How we make decisions on relevant content changes?

Every issue will be reviewed by at least one of the lead authors. 
They have the authority to decide whether the issues is a minor or major change. 
Minor changes can be accepted directly after one review of the lead authors. 
Major changes requires at least 3 reviews by co-authors with relevant knowledge on the specific topics. 
All major changes will remain open for at least 4 weeks to allow all co-authors to provide feedback. 
Every co-author can request a change to be reverted and request further discussion to reach a new consensus. 
Co-authors are encouraged to periodically review GitHub activity as co-authorship implies agreement with the content.  

### Minor change
- typos, language and formatting
- adding images

### Major change 
- adding new sensor descriptions
- change of uncertainties ranges
- concrete suggestions i.e. related to correction of methods
